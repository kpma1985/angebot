‚ÑπÔ∏è:

- Revolutionary Processor: Faster. Smoother. Better. The powerful new GP2 engine changes the game ‚Äì snappy performance, responsive touch controls and double the frame rate for amazingly smooth footage. Designed specifically for the demanding nature of the GoPro, the GP2 ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù is by far our fastest ever.
- HyperSmooth 4.0: HyperSmooth has never been smoother and it‚Äôs easy to dial in the best stabilisation at all times. Plus, get even better low-light performance and horizon levelling with a higher tilt limit, so your footage looks perfectly straight when you want it to.
- High-Res Photos Videos, High Frame Rate: Step up to the sharpest-shooting GoPro ever. Upgraded to incredible 23-MP photos and 5.3K video resolution at 60fps, HERO10 offers double the frame rate for amazingly smooth motion. Plus, there‚Äôs 8x slo-mo at 2.7K and you can pause videos and grab 15.8-MP still photos from 5.3K video that look amazing.
- Fast, Reliable Connectivity: Super easy, super fast. Transferring photos and videos from your cloud-connected GoPro to your phone is simple and versatile, with your choice of effortless wireless upload via the Quik app or a lightning-fast wired connection via USB.3 There‚Äôs also unlimited cloud storage with hassle-free auto upload. Just plug in your camera when it‚Äôs connected to your home Wi-Fi and the camera does the rest.4
- Unbelievable Image Quality: Shoot with fine detail, realistic textures and stunning contrast, even in low light. Images look their best thanks to a new water- shedding hydrophobic lens cover that repels water while helping to eliminate lens flare and other artefacts.
